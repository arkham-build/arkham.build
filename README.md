# arkham.build

> [arkham.build](https://arkham.build) is a web-based deckbuilder for Arkham Horror: The Card Gameâ„¢.

## Metadata additions

arkham.build extends the _arkhamdb deck schema_ with a few fields for additional functionality.

- `meta.extra_deck`: Parallel Jim's spirit deck. Format: comma-separated list of ids `"id1,id2,id3"`.
- `meta.attachments_{code}`: cards that are attached to a specific setup deck, for example _Joe Diamond_ or _Stick to the Plan_. Format: comma-separated list of ids `"id1,id2,id2,id3"`.
- `meta.card_pool`: packs that can be used for this deck. Used for limited pool deckbuilding such as #campaign-playalong. Format: `"<pack_code>,<pack_code>"`. For arkham.build, new format pack codes take precedence over old format.
- `meta.sealed_deck`: card ids that are pickable for this deck. Used for sealed deckbuilding. Format: comma-separated list of `id` / `quantity` pairs in the format `"id:2,id:1,..."`.
- `meta.sealed_deck_name`: name of the sealed deck definition used. format: string.
- `meta.transform_into`: code of the investigator that this deck's investigator has transformed into. I.e. `04244` for _Body of a Yithian_.
- `meta.banner_url`: URL to an image to be displayed as banner for the deck. Preferably aspect ratio `4:1`.
- `meta.intro_md`: Short deck introduction that uses the same markdown format that `description_md` uses.
- `meta.annotation_{code}`: Annotation for a specific card that uses the same markdown format that `description_md` uses. Annotations are not limited to cards in deck, but can also target cards in the side deck (upgrades, alternatives) or _any_ card (reasoning for exclusion).

## File formats

### Sealed decks

The sealed deck feature expects a csv file in the format:

```csv
code,quantity
01039,2
01090,2
06197,2
07032,2
```

In this example, the sealed deck contains two copies of _Deduction_, _Perception_, _Practice Makes Perfect_ and _Promise of Power_, so users would only be able to add these cards to their deck in the deck builder.

## Development

1. Create an `.env` file from `.env.example`.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

## Translations

The app and its data are fully translatable and PRs with new translations are _welcome_.

Translations for the user-interface are handled with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) and live in the `./src/locales/` folder as JSON files.

Translations for cards and metadata are sourced from the [arkhamdb-json-data](https://github.com/Kamalisk/arkhamdb-json-data) and the [arkham-cards-data](https://github.com/zzorba/arkham-cards-data) and assembled by our API.

### Creating translations

1. Create a copy of `en.json` in the `./src/locales` folder and rename it to your locale's ISO 639 code.
2. Add your locale to the `LOCALES` array in `./src/utils/constants`.
3. Run `npm run i18n:pull-data` to pull in some translations (traits, deck options) from ArkhamCards automatically.
4. (if your local has translated card data) Create an issue to get the card data added to the card data backend.
5. Translate and open a PR.

### Updating translations

1. Run `npm run i18n:sync` to sync newly added translation keys to your locale.
2. Run `npm run i18n:pull` to sync translations from ArkhamCards.
3. Update the translation file and open a PR.

## Architecture

arkham.build is a SPA app that, by default, stores data locally in an IndexedDB database. The SPA has several backend components that it uses to enrich functionality.

### api.arkham.build

The API source code is tracked in a private git repo. It has a few functions:

1. a cache for metadata  such as cards and sets.
2. a cached proxy for public ArkhamDB endpoints.
3. a [token-mediating backend](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#name-token-mediating-backend) for authenticated ArkhamDB endpoints.
4. a CRUD API for public _shares_.
5. a generator for opengraph previews.

### Recommendation API

The recommendation API is a seperate [project](https://github.com/TartanLlama/arkham-rec-provider/).

### Cloudflare Pages functions

We leverage a few Cloudflare Pages functions for rewriting the HTML we serve to _some_ clients. Currently, this is used to inject OpenGraph tags for social media bots.

### API

The API is a separate, private git project.

### Icons

Arkham-related SVG icons are sourced from ArkhamCards's [icomoon project](https://github.com/zzorba/ArkhamCards/blob/master/assets/icomoon/project.json) and loaded as webfonts. Additional icons are bundled as SVG via `vite-plugin-svgr` or imported from `lucide-react`.
