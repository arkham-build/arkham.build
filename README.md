# arkham.build

> [arkham.build](https://arkham.build) is a web-based deckbuilder for Arkham Horror: The Card Game‚Ñ¢.

üó∫Ô∏è [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/fspoettel/projects/5)

## Metadata additions

arkham.build extends the _arkhamdb deck schema_ with a few fields for additional functionality.

- `meta.extra_deck`: Parallel Jim's spirit deck. Format: comma-separated list of ids `"id1,id2,id3"`.
- `meta.attachments_{code}`: cards that are attached to a specific setup deck, for example _Joe Diamond_ or _Stick to the Plan_. Format: comma-separated list of ids `"id1,id2,id2,id3"`.
- `meta.card_pool`: packs that can be used for this deck. Used for limited pool deckbuilding such as #campaign-playalong. Format: `"<pack_code>,<pack_code>"`. For arkham.build, new format pack codes take precedence over old format.

## Development

1. Create an `.env` file from `.env.example`.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

### API

The API is a separate, private git project hosted as a Cloudflare worker.

### Icons

Arkham-related SVG icons are sourced from ArkhamCards's [icomoon project](https://github.com/zzorba/ArkhamCards/blob/master/assets/icomoon/project.json) and loaded as webfonts. Additional icons are bundled as SVG via `vite-plugin-svgr` or imported from `lucide-react`.
