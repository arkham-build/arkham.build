# arkham.build

> [arkham.build](https://arkham.build) is a web-based deckbuilder for Arkham Horror: The Card Game‚Ñ¢.

üó∫Ô∏è [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/fspoettel/projects/5)

## Metadata additions

arkham.build extends the _arkhamdb deck schema_ with a few fields for additional functionality.

- `meta.extra_deck`: Parallel Jim's spirit deck. Format: comma-separated list of ids `"id1,id2,id3"`.
- `meta.attachments_{code}`: cards that are attached to a specific setup deck, for example _Joe Diamond_ or _Stick to the Plan_. Format: comma-separated list of ids `"id1,id2,id2,id3"`.
- `meta.card_pool`: packs that can be used for this deck. Used for limited pool deckbuilding such as #campaign-playalong. Format: `"<pack_code>,<pack_code>"`. For arkham.build, new format pack codes take precedence over old format.
- `meta.sealed_deck`: card ids that are pickable for this deck. Used for sealed deckbuilding. Format: comma-separated list of `id` / `quantity` pairs in the format `"id:2,id:1,..."`.
- `meta.sealed_deck_name`: name of the sealed deck definition used. format: string.
- `meta.transform_into`: code of the investigator that this deck's investigator has transformed into. I.e. `04244` for _Body of a Yithian_.

## File formats

### Sealed decks

The sealed deck feature expects a csv file in the format:

```csv
code,quantity
01039,2
01090,2
06197,2
07032,2
```

In this example, the sealed deck contains two copies of _Deduction_, _Perception_, _Practice Makes Perfect_ and _Promise of Power_, so users would only be able to add these cards to their deck in the deck builder.

## Development

1. Create an `.env` file from `.env.example`.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

## Architecture

arkham.build is a SPA app that, by default, stores data locally in an IndexedDB database by default. The SPA has several backend components that it talks to.

### api.arkham.build

Our API is tracked in a private git repo. It has a few functions:
1. a cache for metadata (cards and sets).
2. a cached proxy for public ArkhamDB endpoints.
3. a [token-mediating backend](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#name-token-mediating-backend) for authenticated ArkhamDB endpoints.
4. a CRUD API for our public _shares_.
5. a generator for opengraph previews.

### Recommendation API

The recommendation API is a seperate [project](https://github.com/TartanLlama/arkham-rec-provider/).

### Cloudflare Pages functions

We leverage a few Cloudflare Pages functions for rewriting the HTML we serve to _some_ clients. Currently, this is used to inject OpenGraph tags for social media bots.

### API

The API is a separate, private git project.

### Opengraph previews

Opengraph previews are generated by 


### Icons

Arkham-related SVG icons are sourced from ArkhamCards's [icomoon project](https://github.com/zzorba/ArkhamCards/blob/master/assets/icomoon/project.json) and loaded as webfonts. Additional icons are bundled as SVG via `vite-plugin-svgr` or imported from `lucide-react`.
