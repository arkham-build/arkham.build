# arkham.build

> [arkham.build](https://arkham.build) is a web-based deckbuilder for Arkham Horror: The Card Game‚Ñ¢.

üó∫Ô∏è [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/fspoettel/projects/5)

## Development

### API

The API is a separate, private git project hosted as a Cloudflare worker. It mainly serves as a cache for the ArkhamCards GraphQL API and a proxy for some arkhamdb API routes.

### Icons

Arkham-related SVG icons are sourced from ArkhamCards's [icomoon project](https://github.com/zzorba/ArkhamCards/blob/master/assets/icomoon/project.json) and loaded as webfonts. Additional icons are bundled as SVG via `vite-plugin-svgr` or imported from `lucide-react`.
