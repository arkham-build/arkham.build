Sure, all the other investigators have a bit of blurse tech they could use, but I would much rather play my [Kōhaku Narukami](/card/10012) deck next to an [Alessandra Zorzi](/card/10009) deck, or anyone else, and be able to tell my friend: _Don't worry, you won't notice it._\r\n\r\nAnd so that's the guiding principle of this deck:   \r\n> **Make sure that you won't leave <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> tokens in the bag for your teammates.**  \r\n\r\nBecause even 3 <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> and 3 <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> can lead to annoying situations during the Mythos Phase.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't be put off by the difficulty of this deck, especially when playing it during a campaign, as the complexity increases along with your experience playing it, and learning how to master _The Folklorist_ is extremely satisfying.\r\n___\r\n\r\nAs the new expansion comes out, it is time for some blind runs! I have been publishing deck guides for each investigator from the last 2 expansions, so this year, I decided to make it a little bit different. I asked other content creators to join in for the fun!\r\n\r\n[![ahc76-preview-590x250.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/zX6B8cs2/ahc76-preview-590x250.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/F7bmxDs0)\r\n\r\nHere are the decks and resources related to each investigator:\r\n* <span class=\"fg-guardian\"> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> ** Wilson Richards **</span>\r\n  * [DerBK](https://arkhamdb.com/user/profile/32108/DerBK) from the [Ancient Evils Blog](https://derbk.com/ancientevils/)\r\n  * [The Article about this Wilson Deck](https://derbk.com/ancientevils/tools-gold-a-wilson-richards-primer/)\r\n  * [The ArkhamDB Deck Guide](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/47005/tool-guys-don-t-look-at-explosions-fhv-intro-deck-guide-1.0)\r\n*  <span class=\"fg-seeker\">  <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> ** Kate Winthrop **</span>\r\n  * [ElseWhere](https://arkhamdb.com/user/profile/25253/ElseWhere) from the [Strength in Numbers Blog](https://strengthinnumbersarkham.wordpress.com/)\r\n  * [The article about this Kate Deck](https://strengthinnumbersarkham.wordpress.com/2024/02/20/an-introduction-to-kate-winthrop/)\r\n  * [The ArkhamDB Deck Guide](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/47002/kate-doesn-t-need-roads-fhv-intro-deck-guide-1.0)\r\n*  <span class=\"fg-rogue\"> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> **Alessandra Zorzi **</span>\r\n  * [dscarpac](https://arkhamdb.com/user/profile/38596/dscarpac) from the [Quick Learner Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Quick_Learner)\r\n  * [The Youtube video presenting the Deck](https://youtu.be/sDVzZ_TZ-i4)\r\n  * [The ArkhamDB Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/47003/alessandra-s-parley-party-fhv-intro-deck-guide-1.0)\r\n*  <span class=\"fg-mystic\"> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> ** Kōhaku Narukami **</span>  \r\n  * [Valentin1331](https://arkhamdb.com/user/profile/42890/Valentin1331)\r\n  * [The ArkhamDB Deck Guide](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/47001)\r\n*  <span class=\"fg-survivor\"> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> ** Hank Samson** </span>  \r\n  * Justin from PlayingBoardGames [[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PlayingBoardGames) & [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/playingboardgames)]\r\n  * [The Youtube video presenting the Deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfkskzdg03Q)\r\n  * [The ArkhamDB Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/47006/tank-samson-fhv-intro-deck-guide-1.0)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<center> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> </span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> </center> \r\n\r\n** <center>   <span style=\"font-family:papyrus;

Note that this is _optional_ and doesn't require [Gabriel](/card/10052) to exhaust.\r\n\r\n* The [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056) also add a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> when using them to investigate. Note that they only exhaust to get an additional clue.\r\n\r\n* [Promise of Power](/card/07032) can generate a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> in a pinch.\r\n\r\n* [Deep Knowledge](/card/07023) and [Faustian Bargain](/card/07028) add 2 <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> tokens each.\r\n\r\n** Using your <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> Tokens: **\r\n\r\n* [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) can be used once a turn to pull a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> token: \r\n\r\n  * During an [Armageddon](/card/07117) test to either get your charge back (practically making [Armageddon](/card/07117) endless) or deal 3 damage in one attack.\r\n\r\n  * During a [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056) test to get 2 clues.\r\n\r\n  * During [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) or [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102) so you get it back to your hand at the end of your turn.\r\n\r\n * On any other test in which you committed 2 [Fey](/card/07222) for a total of +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, +4 <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> skill value to this test.\r\n\r\n* If you need more than one <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> per turn, you have [Favor of the Moon](/card/07271).\r\n\r\n  * This is really good to use [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056) to get 2 clues, and [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) the same turn, or attack twice this turn with [Armageddon](/card/07117).\r\n\r\n   * Using [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) and [Favor of the Moon](/card/07271) on the same test once is enough to trigger the [Seal of the Elders](/card/10105) and summon a [Servant of Brass](/card/10107). From now on, a single [Armageddon](/card/07117) + <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> attack is worth 5 damage! \r\n\r\n  * Don't forget to gain 1 resource when using a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> from the [Favor of the Moon](/card/07271).\r\n\r\n* [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) is the last big <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> consumer.\r\n\r\n   * Gaining 2 resources per turn pays for your setup and, even more importantly, your incessant use of [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) and [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n** Adding <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> Tokens: **\r\n\r\n* There is only one way in this deck to add <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> tokens: [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s ability.\r\n\r\n  * Because [Gabriel Carillo](/card/10052) has the same <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> window as [Kōhaku](/card/10012) you can chose which one to trigger first. If your bag has 1 <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> / 0 <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span>, you can first activate [Gabriel](/card/10052) to reach 1/1 and then [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s ability to add a 2nd <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> token.\r\n\r\n** Using <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> Tokens: **\r\n\r\n* These tokens are then easy to pull with the [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013), (as long as there is 1 more <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> or a tie). This triggers the [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122) for a secured success since no other token is revealed.\r\n\r\n  * Starting a turn with a <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> token can be helpful in case you draw treachery that justifies using your [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) during the Mythos phase, like a [Grasping Hands](/card/01162) for instance.\r\n  \r\n* Because [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) and [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102) come back to your hand with any symbol, it is preferable to use a <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> + [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122) when playing them to avoid the <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>.\r\n\r\n  * If you have enough resources, or you are low in health/sanity, you can use [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) to heal anyone at your location, <span class=\"icon-free\"></span>, significantly decreasing the chances of anyone in your party being defeated.\r\n\r\nDon't forget that [Kōhaku Narukami](/card/10012)'s ability is optional, so you are not forced to use it. But overall, leaving <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> tokens in the bag will most likely be appreciated unless your partner is [Stella Clark](/card/60501).\r\n___\r\n\r\n<center> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> </span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> </center> \r\n\r\n** <center>   <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:rebeccapurple; font-size:x-large;\"> Turn and Sequence examples: </center> **\r\n\r\nEvery turn will start by assessing your board state and what you need to do this round.\r\n\r\n1. Decide if you need to investigate, fight or anything else, and check the bag situation.\r\n\r\n2. Check how many <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> generators you want to use: [Gabriel Carillo](/card/10052) if you need to draw, and [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056) if you need to investigate, or events like [Deep Knowledge](/card/07023).\r\n\r\n3. Check how many <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> consumers you have: [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013), [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104), [Favor of the Moon](/card/07271) in hand.\r\n\r\n4. Decide if you want to add a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> or a <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> with [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s ability and start your turn.  \r\n\r\n`Pro tip:  ` \r\n* It helps to pair cards: [Gabriel](/card/10052) and [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) cancel one another's tokens.  \r\n* Then:\r\n  * Add a <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> if you play any other card that adds <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> to the bag ([Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056), [Promise of Power](/card/07032), [Deep Knowledge](/card/07023), [Faustian Bargain](/card/07028)). \r\n  * Add a <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> to prevent <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> if you want to play [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102) or [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101).\r\n  * Otherwise, add a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span>.\r\n\r\n* Please use the Bless/Curse token counter provided by FFG in this box.

So, you can save some hassle by just skipping the token part and exhaust [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) to draw 1 card and 2 resources without interfering with the bag.\r\n\r\n* There are 2 important <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> other player windows that are good to know for using [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104).\r\n\r\n   * The first one is just after any player draws 1 encounter card. This means that you can use it during the Mythos Phase before any test happens to remove a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> that is left from the previous turn and make sure it is not pulled during a test on a treachery card.\r\n\r\n  * The second one is when an investigator's turn begins, so before even [Kōhaku](/card/10012) and [Gabriel](/card/10052)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. This can help you manipulate the bag so you start your turn with the optimal situation for your plans.\r\n\r\n* As you set up your board, you will, for instance, not necessarily use [Gabriel Carillo](/card/10052)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> if you didn't find [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) yet, so you do not overload the bag with <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> you can't absorb.\r\n\r\n* The Mulligan priorities to accelerate your set-up are:\r\n\r\n   * [Backpack (2)](/card/53011) (If you don't have it, do yourself a favour and proxy it with the level 0)\r\n\r\n   * [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) so you can use <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> tokens immediately with your [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122) and start succeeding tests.\r\n\r\n   * [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) or [Faustian Bargain](/card/07028) to pay for your setup\r\n\r\n  * [Deep Knowledge](/card/07023) to get more cards.\r\n\r\n  * [Spectral Razor](/card/06201) in case you pull an early enemy or [Armageddon](/card/07117) if you also have the [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013).\r\n\r\n  * Anything else goes back into your deck.\r\n\r\n* Once set up, this deck is extraordinary by its consistency, dealing levels of damage main fighters often struggle to deliver while also picking up clues at a tempo expected to main cluevers. But because it is all very combo-y, it can take a little while to assemble all the puzzle pieces, and one missing can make the scenario really challenging. That's why the deck has a lot of draw and tutors.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<center> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> </span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> </center> \r\n\r\n** <center>   <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:rebeccapurple; font-size:x-large;\"> Other Cards: </center> **\r\n\r\n[![FHV.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MHFt290h/FHV.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/LgjjjBbT)\r\n\r\n* [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) is a good way to start with [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122), without which the deck really struggles. We choose 2 mental trauma.\r\n\r\n* [Backpack (2)](/card/53011) is the unsung hero of many decks. It speeds up your set-up tremendously. \r\n\r\n  * A typical first turn is to add 1 <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> with [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s ability, then play the [Backpack (2)](/card/53011), and immediately from it [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) and [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013), for 5 resources, and you get 2 resources back right after, during the other investigator's turn or the beginning of the enemy phase.\r\n\r\n  * While only hitting 1 target with the [Backpack (2)](/card/53011) may _feel_ bad, the key combo pieces of this deck are so vital that it is still a good outcome. And if it whiffs, tell yourself that it means that you would have spent the equivalent of 12 turns (almost an entire scenario) without seeing your combo piece, so just by shuffling your deck, [Backpack (2)](/card/53011) is helping you already!\r\n\r\n* [Faustian Bargain](/card/07028) is here because [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) sometimes hides, and it makes the board really hard to set up. \r\n\r\n  * On top of that, it can help teammates and/or add 2 <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> before you play a [Favor of the Moon](/card/07271). Finally, it can even be committed to [Armageddon](/card/07117), [Read the Signs](/card/06117) or [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056).\r\n\r\n* [Guts](/card/01089) and [Perception](/card/01090) are mostly here to support tests before you find [Fey](/card/07222), and as cantrips to speed up the pace at which you hit your combo cards.\r\n\r\n* [Prescient](/card/60419) is great in this deck because you secure some Symbol tokens each turn, so you can effectively use it to recur [Read the Signs](/card/06117) and [Spectral Razor](/card/06201) whenever you attack with [Armageddon](/card/07117).\r\n\r\n* [Promise of Power](/card/07032) helps with skills you are afraid to fail, like <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> scenario tests or an early important test before you found [Fey](/card/07222).\r\n\r\n** Level 0 Deck: **\r\n\r\nThe early deck relies much more on the [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122) to secure one test per turn.\r\n\r\n* [Crystal Pendulum](/card/60411) is a great addition since you know in advance, once per turn, how much you will succeed by.\r\n\r\n* [Scroll of Secrets](/card/05116) is great to have some filtered draw. Even if it competes for the hand slot, their contribution to set up is very appreciated.\r\n\r\n* [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) is fantastic in this deck, and upgrading to [Gabriel Carillo](/card/10052) is almost only for the Lore. Finding your spells is extremely important, and she does it arguably better than the geometry teacher.\r\n\r\n* [Explosive Ward](/card/09087) is a great way to have 2 testless damage in case you didn't find [Armageddon](/card/07117) yet. And even after, it is a solid 1-ping for early enemies. \r\n\r\n  * Because it is testless, it is also a great answer to [Weeping Yurei](/card/10014).\r\n\r\n  * The icons are also great to commit to a [Spectral Razor](/card/06201) test.\r\n\r\n* Speaking of testless damage, another option is [Occult Lexicon](/card/05316), which has great flexibility: \r\n\r\n  * Draw, which can be found by the [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) since [Blood-Rite](/card/05317) is a _Spell_.\r\n\r\n  * Resources in case you don't find [Faustian Bargain](/card/07028).\r\n\r\n  * Testless damage, again, interesting against the [Weeping Yurei](/card/10014).\r\n\r\n* [Diabolical Luck](/card/10075) is a great way to deal with early <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span>, before you get [Fey](/card/07222). The fact that it is reactive makes this card a 0 cost [Lucky!](/card/01080) for <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span>.\r\n\r\n**Luxury Upgrades:**\r\n\r\nAfter you reach the displayed version of the deck, the only valuable upgrades I could come up with are:\r\n\r\n* [Occult Reliquary](/card/10132) + [Eye of the Djinn](/card/07225)\r\n\r\n  * Since we pull a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> every turn, the [Eye of the Djinn](/card/07225) is a great way to have a 4th action every turn with no downside. \r\n\r\n  * After adding the [Eye of the Djinn](/card/07225), we have 4 colours, so we can use [Close the Circle](/card/08062) for 3 bonus actions or [Call for Backup](/card/08129), which is one of the only cards that can heal [Servant of Brass](/card/10107).\r\n\r\n**Cards that didn't make the cut:**\r\n\r\n* [Tempt Fate](/card/07037) is probably one of the most surprising cards that is not in this deck. It _is_ good in [Kōhaku Narukami](/card/10012), but it does what I didn't want this deck to do: add more blurse in the bag than what I can reliably use and, therefore, increase the variance of tests for my whole team.\r\n\r\n* [Control Variable](/card/10046) has been part of my testing, but it didn't give me enough value. The reason was mainly that this deck picks up clues 2 by 2, and clues are often X <span class=\"icon-per_investigator\"></span>, which results in even numbers unless you play true solo. In this case, its worth increases significantly.\r\n\r\n* [Blasphemous Covenant](/card/07113) is the one I tried the most, but the problem is that it leaves the <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> in the bag. It can be helpful when you want to use the same Token for both [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) and [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104), but in practice, it mostly prevents us from clearing the bag.\r\n\r\n* [Guided by Faith](/card/10025) is good, especially since we have the [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122), but adding 2 <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> in the bag can mess up our ability to control the bag by choosing at all time what token to add with [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s ability. The same reason explains why [Purified](/card/10029) is not in the deck.\r\n\r\n* [Mesmeric Influence](/card/10096), [Mind Wipe](/card/01068) and to a lesser extent [Manipulate Destiny](/card/07162) are great options to fight [Weeping Yurei](/card/10014), but in practice, we either use [Spectral Razor](/card/06201) (which is great since it's Aloof) or we throw one [Armageddon](/card/07117) charge and accept to take 2 horror. [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) can easily heal it anyway.\r\n\r\n* [Wicked Athame](/card/10092) is good, but doesn't fit this deck. First of all, we almost never need additional charges on [Armageddon](/card/07117), [Armageddon](/card/07117) can already deal with 2,3 and 4hp enemies quite well, and finally, our hands are already full with greater value.\r\n\r\n* [Beloved](/card/07036) didn't make the cut because, with the [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122), <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> plays the same role, but is permanent and repeatable. It's not bad, but it's not good enough to justify a deck space.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<center> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> </span>

collection\" means you have all the Investigator Expansions released in the Revised format at this deck's publishing date.

If you own these 2 expansions, you can refer to the Full collection decks.\r\n\r\n`Disclaimer:` The following decks have not all been tested. Some of them are the results of pure theory-crafting. I am happy to get any feedback to improve them.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Flex build:**\r\n\r\n* Full collection: this is the deck displayed in the guide.\r\n\r\n* Revised collection: If you don't have The Innsmouth Conspiracy yet, you are missing key pieces for this deck, notably [Fey](/card/07222), [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122) and [Armageddon](/card/07117).\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3594897)\r\n\r\n  * [19xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3594915)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3594926)\r\n\r\n  * Strategy: \r\n    * 0xp: [Eldritch Initiation](/card/09086) and [Explosive Ward](/card/09087) benefit from [Occult Reliquary](/card/10132), which gives you an additional Arcane Slot from turn 1, which can then be changed to a Hand Slot when you need to hold 3 Hand items. \r\n    * 19xp: At the beginning of your turn, generate a <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> with [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s ability, and use the <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> from [Gabriel](/card/10052) to get 2 resources with [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104). This will give you enough resources to use [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) and [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102) every turn, and return it to your hand thanks to [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) or [Prescient](/card/60419).\r\n    * Full xp: When you have [Recall the Future](/card/04158) and you need to pull a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> for [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056), call <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> and it should be enough to mitigate the negative modifier.\r\n\r\nNote that the complete Innsmouth Conspiracy campaign is currently available on the official website and in many places, so if you have a few bucks at hand, I would advise getting it, as it's also a really good campaign!  \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Cluever build:**\r\n\r\n* Full collection: \r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3621267)\r\n\r\n  * [19xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3621257)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3621326)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: There's not much to say here. The deck is really similar to the one in the guide.\r\n\r\n* Revised collection:\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3641514)\r\n\r\n  * [19xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3641530)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3641503)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: [Occult Reliquary](/card/10132) can give you an Arcane Slot from the start to get 3 cards out of [Eldritch Initiation](/card/09086) and then switches to a Hand Slot when you need to play a 3rd card there. The rest is token management, as explained in the above guide.\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Fighter build:**   \r\n\r\n* Full collection:\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3595024)\r\n\r\n  * [19xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3558492)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3595026)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: this build relies much more on the <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> synergy, which is strong while also making everything more manageable for your team. Remember that [Kōhaku](/card/10012)'s reaction is optional, so you don't need to add a <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> every turn. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Revised collection:\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3641332)\r\n\r\n  * [19xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3641251)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3641315)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: same as above, except it is not nearly as good. I am adding this build, but I would advise playing someone other than [Kōhaku](/card/10012) as a fighter with a limited card pool, like [Hank](/card/10015).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**True Solo Build:**\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a comment mentioning struggling with the Deck in True Solo, I made a particular declination of the deck dedicated to this play style, as I know it's hard for True Solo players to find some adequate decks.\r\n\r\n* Full collection:\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3623228) with Upgrade Path\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3623222)\r\n\r\n  * Strategy: [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) + [Ancient Covenant](/card/07122) once per turn / Gain resources with [Faustian Bargain](/card/07028) and [Voice of Ra](/card/60416), and spend them on [Arcane Studies](/card/60428) to increase your skill value / Brute force tests with Skill cards like [Promise of Power](/card/07032), [Perception](/card/01090) or [Guts](/card/01089).\r\n\r\n\r\n* Revised collection:\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck with Upgrade Path](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3628298)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3628313)\r\n\r\n  * Strategy: [Occult Reliquary](/card/10132) can be used to gain an additional Arcane Slot from the start of the scenario to get 3 cards from [Eldritch Initiation](/card/09086) or 3 damage from [Explosive Ward](/card/09087). Only when you play a 3rd Hand Slot can you change [Occult Reliquary](/card/10132)'s slot to Hand, decreasing the effectiveness of the above cards. But by then, you should be pretty comfortably set to win. Then the deck relies on getting resources to fuel [Arcane Studies](/card/01062), and [Recall the Future](/card/04158) to compensate for <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> tokens.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n** Bless-heavy builds:\r\n\r\nPlaying in a team that leans heavily on <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> tokens can heavily hinder your strategy. [Kōhaku](/card/10012) will only be able to add <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span>, and [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013)/[The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) will only pull <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> tokens. This means that we cannot rely on the resources or on [Armageddon](/card/07117) / [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056)'s abilities.\r\n\r\n* Flex in a Bless-heavy Team:\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3683688)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3674355)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: In a blessed team, the <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> are less penalising, and if they survive through the Mythos Phase, you can then use them for an additional action. [Jewel of Aureolus](/card/02269) pays for [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) and [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102). [Rite of Equilibrium](/card/07308) is one of the only cards that can heal [Keeper of the Key](/card/10106) (summoned by [Seal of the Elders](/card/10105)) for tons of testless clues. [Arcane Research](/card/04109) decreases the experience cost of all the _Spells_. Plan your upgrades to get the best out of it between each Scenario.\r\n\r\n* Cluever in a Bless-heavy Team:\r\n\r\nSame as above, playing in <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> heavy team as a Cluever [Kōhaku](/card/10012) prevents you from using [The Key of Solomon](/card/10104) to pay for your spells, and [Book of Living Myths](/card/10013) to pull the <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> for your [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056). So we need to find alternate strategies.\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3683812)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3683813)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: In a blessed team, the <span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> are less penalising, and if they survive through the Mythos Phase, you can then use them for an additional action. [Jewel of Aureolus](/card/02269) pays for [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101). [Rite of Equilibrium](/card/07308) is one of the only cards that can heal [Keeper of the Key](/card/10106) (summoned by [Seal of the Elders](/card/10105)) for tons of testless clues. [Arcane Research](/card/04109) decreases the experience cost of all the _Spells_. Plan your upgrades to get the best out of it between each Scenario. Because the deck doesn't need a lot of experience, [Fortune or Fate](/card/05237) can be used in every scenario in the late campaign.\r\n\r\n* Fighter in a Bless-heavy team:\r\n\r\nBecause the fighter build already leans towards <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span> tech, I recommend using the one above.\r\n___\r\n\r\n** Core + FHV Investigator Campaign: **\r\n\r\n* Even with this small collection, a fun [Kōhaku](/card/10012) build is available for you!\r\n\r\n  * [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3644485)\r\n\r\n  * [Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/3644509)\r\n\r\n    * Strategy: At the beginning, use [Wicked Athame](/card/10092) on 3hp enemies to finish them and replenish your [Shrivelling](/card/01060). As you gain experience, kill enemies with the [Blessed Blade](/card/07018) or [Spectral Razor (2)](/card/10102) and find clues with [Prismatic Spectacles](/card/10056) and [Read the Signs (2)](/card/10101) depending on if you want to add or remove <span class=\"icon-bless\"></span>/<span class=\"icon-curse\"></span> tokens from the bag.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n_[To create your own guides, find the template here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWi3g82i65MV8p6c4VKkYbKDT2blkim4STZ4tpugCNI/edit?usp=sharing)_",
